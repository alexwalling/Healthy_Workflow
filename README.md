# Healthy_Workflow
Stay active and healthy while you're working on your computer


## Inspiration
While we are all at these hackathon it can be easy to get so deep into your code that you forget about absolutely everything, including your health.  I wanted to change this and help not only hackers, but everyday computer users, to improve their health while working.
## What it does
Healthy Workflow is a chrome extension that reminds you on a timed interval to take a break and do a quick workout.  This causes you to improve your health even while working on a computer for hours on end.  It has a select number of workouts that can be randomly generated for you to do.
## How I built it
I started with learning how to write a chrome extension.  Then as I worked on it I kept adding features and functionality to it until I reached where Healthy Workflow is now.
## Challenges I ran into
Challenges I ran into were not knowing how to write a chrome extension and learning how all the pieces worked together.  I also had trouble with the alerts, I wanted to be able to alert you even when you didn't have chrome open but the best way I found to do that was using the javascript alert.  This did not look very good.  I wanted to implement a workout tracking system but I ran into the challenges of time restrictions and being extremely tired, so I was unable to implement the workout tracking this weekend.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that I got a hack done.  I had trouble coming up with an idea I was actually passionate about until I came up with this 18-24 hours before submissions were due.
## What I learned
Most importantly I learned how important it is to be healthy even while working or at a hackathon.  I learned how chrome extensions work which will be really useful and exciting to develop in the future.  I also learned more about how JSONs, HTML, and CSS work.  
## What's next for Healthy Workflow
As I said I was unable to implement the workout tracking, but I would also like to implement a drink water reminder, blocking certain websites that it is easy to get off task on until you have a break, and adding your own workouts to the data set.  I do think this extension could be something that becomes useful for people and could be used well.
